# Some Notes: 
# - quote the strings with : or - because these are YAML special chars
# - avoid / symbol 
# - if _ (underscore) is needed in PDF: TeX needs \_ so you write \\_ in YAML
#   because YAML converts \\ to \
# - if _ is a part of url - put the whole url into \url{} brackets 
# - COMPILE TWICE when done - TeX is finiky
